This is a [Next.js 13,](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app@latest --experimental-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## About the Project
In this project I tried to implement `apDir` Next 13 experimental feature, for implementing frontend for Sanity.io clienet. Basically the content is similary to a blog but has used some featured model for my purpose.

## Modules Used
1. TailwindCSS
2. Nextjs 13
3. Disy UI
4. sanity CMS
5. next-sanity
6. react-syntax-highlighter
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
